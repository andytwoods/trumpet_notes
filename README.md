Being a coder, and a psychologist, and wanting to learn the trumpet, I thought, why not, let's create a spaced interval learning tool to speed up my *and your* progress. I feel this tool will be particularly useful for those who struggle with musical notation. 

## Installation
Download this package and open index.html in your browser. This package will also be hosted on [www.andytwoods.com](andytwoods.com).

## An apology to JS developers
I built this app whilst isolating due to covid. To keep me keen, I've used 'old-school' JS and have only a few spatterings of tests.

## How to contribute?
All contributions are appreciated! To contribute, simply create a new branch with your contribution and raise a PR! You
can ping @andytwoods should any issues arise!

## Features in the pipeline
- Spectrum analyser so the trumpet player can play a note and we can check whether it is correct. 
- Backend (Django) to store progress. 
- More sophisticated spaced learning algorithms.
